# Features​
**1. Set entity spawn chance.**  
It will cancel the spawn event and save CPU resource consumption which caused by entities activity. You can add any entity you want in config. For example, the Guardian tower spawn mobs really fast, and a large number of jumping Guardians will cause server lag.

**2. Set entity spawn condition.**  
* Reason
* Biome
* Water or Air
* World and Location
* Day or Night

**3. Set creature amount limit.**  
You can easily control the number and spawn chance of monsters in a specific range. Avoid spawning too many creatures.

**4. Reduce creature spawn amount when player is AFK.** (Need CMI) 
Improve other players' gaming experience and increase server TPS.

**5. Purge creatures near the player when the he enters AFK.** (Need CMI)  

**6. Change illegal spawners and randomly choose a new type, then execute custom commands.** (Support PlaceHolderAPI, BungeeCord)

**7. Support MythicMobs.**

**8. Improve MythicMobs "RandomSpawn" and avoid the bug of spawn mobs without limit.**

**9. Money & exp multiplier by permission for MythicMobs.**  
You can set higher reward for VIP player. If player has multiple multipliers, he will get more rewards than just the highest multiplier. (Calculation method: addition or multiplication)
